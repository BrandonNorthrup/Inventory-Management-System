# Inventory-Management-System
This project creates an inventory management system GUI for any company that requires a database to keep track of their current inventory. You can add or remove products from the list, as well as any individual parts that are associated with the products. You can also identify which parts and products are made in-house or outsourced. Prices and quantities may also be added.
